# StupidAIBrowser
This is a Stupid AI Browser as seen on my YouTube!

**Note:** Most of the Browser seen in the `__main__.py` file was generated by ChatGPT. I edited the file to make it the "Stupid AI Browser" that is here now.

## Installation
To install this, you can clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thegregtechguy/StupidAIBrowser.git
```

Then, go into the directory and add your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to the JSON file.

You can then run the browser using Python (version 3):
```sh
python3 ./__main__.py
```

**You need to have [google-generativeai](https://pypi.org/project/google-generativeai/), [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/), and [PyQt-WebEngine](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6-WebEngine/) installed for the browser to launch!**
